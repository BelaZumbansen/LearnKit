LearnKit Module
================

Library intended to provide several, easy to access, generic implementations of common Machine Learning algorithms. As of this moment the library includes
the following algorithms, however, it is intended to be a work in progress and more will be added in the future.
- Simulated Annealing
- Hill Climbing
- K Means
- Parallel Search

The intent of this project was to better understand Machine Learning algorithms by implementing them myself from scratch. Additionally, I considered this a
good practice tool for familiarizing myself with Python.
